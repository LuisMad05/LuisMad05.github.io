I am currently a computer science student at Cal State Fullerton and I expect to graduate in 2027

## Favorite 120L Cpsc Labs
* Lab 1

   Lab 1 was enjoyable because I had the first opportunity to actually use a coding language and write out code that would then be checked and verified to see if it was done correctly. While it was a struggle at first the reward at the end is always the best feeling and completing the tasks was for sure an enjoyable aspect. It also was the beginning of some friendships as we all tried to help each other and work together as well.

* Lab 2 

  I enjoyed lab 2 because it was starting to pick up at the time a bit more difficulty and I was able to add in statements and not just integer variables. It started to feel more like what computer science would be like and would look more like the career path I was thinking of going into which had more to do with the software and programming side of cs. It was also nice to see the end result of a lot more code being written out on the software.

* Lab 6 - Part 2

  I enjoyed this lab the most because I liked the aspect of assigning the lists and variables to a corresponding card and its value. I also really enjoy playing Black Jack so applying the knowledge I already have with the game made it so much easier to implement the variable names and values. Testing the results was also fun to see come out correctly.
